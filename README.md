## (1) Description

A personal project to create a react MERN stack app which has a number of simple games. I used trial and error and ChatGPT prompting. 

This was built with React, Node, Javascript, and CSS. 

The game had to be divided up into the smallest working components/units. It began as a game screen with a moving ship, then a couple of asteroids which moved randomly. Collision detection and projectile shooting were put in later.

## (4) Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sifzerda/asteroids.git
cd asteroids
npm install
npm run start
```

## (5) Usage

 The app executes a version of the retro arcade game 'asteroids'. Parts:
 
 - Start screen
 - Game
 - Final score page + score submission
 - High scores page
 - If logged on: profile page with User scores.

## (6) Dev Stuff: Building:

The main functions of code:

1. <u>Initialization, Positioning:</u> mmmmmm.
2. <u>Movement:</u> A useEffect hook and EventListeners on keydown enable ship movement with arrow keys. useEffect calls moveShip and rotateShip on key-press.
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
7. <u>'const initialTableau':</u> Creates Tableau into 7 cols, each col contains the number of cards as it's id (e.g. col 7 contains 7 cards). Initializes empty. Originally tableau sliced off cards from the stockpile, but the 'card sharing' caused issues and had to be reworked.
8. <u>'const Solitaire':</u> Runs main game code (i.e. covers user activity).
9. <u>'const updatedCards', 'const updatedDecks'</u> The state of each foundation suit deck is trackable separately and updated per card dropped.
10. <u>'const [currentCardIndex, setCurrentCardIndex] = useState(0)', 'const nextCard' + onClick={nextCard}:</u> Actions the Stockpile click cycle. 
11. <u>'const shuffleArray':</u> shuffles cards in stockpile and tableau after distribution.
12. <u>'const onDragEnd':</u> Collects and Executes all DnD functions for stockpile, tableau and foundations:
   - <u>'const handleStockpileToTableauDrop':</u> DnD from Stockpile to Tableau;
   - <u>'const handleTableauToTableauDrop':</u> DnD from Tableau to Tableau;
   - <u>'handleFoundationDrop':</u> DnD from any to Foundations.
13. <u>'return':</u> renders stockpile ('cards'), tableau, and foundations and contains in DnD areas.
Other:
1.  <u>'else if (source.droppableId.startsWith('tableau')...)':</u> Enables tableau cards to be dragged in stacks (piles), from source.index -> last-item. 
2.  <u>'return {... t-drag-card-group}':</u> this targets a tableau -> tableau pile of cards and applies a class selector which allowed me to modify appearance of dragging card pile as a single object/stack. React Beautiful DnD didn't seem to have a 'group/multiple object/s' dragging graphic, so I had to make it manually with CSS.
3.  <u>return {...}</u> conditionally renders tableau card as faceup or facedown depending on card's array index.
4.  <u>'index === pile.cards.length - 1 ? ...'</u> Conditional rendering of card DnD based on whether card is faceup or facedown. Facedown cards are not draggable. Tableau.pile array -1 is facedown (i.e. everything but top card).
5.  <u>'const initialTableau': </u>'faceUp' property tracks faceup cards.

## (8) To do: 

- [x] Create basic black game screen
- [x] Create moving ship 
- [x] Create some randomly moving asteroids
- [ ] Make more asteroids and different size asteroids
- [ ] Enable projectile firing
- [ ] Projectile collision detection with asteroids
- [ ] Ship detection with asteroids
- [ ] When you shoot an asteroid it disappears
  - [ ] When you shoot asteroids they break into two smaller, and so on
- [ ] improve graphics elements
- [ ] refine ship movement; add limited inertia, add acceleration (longer you hold down up, faster you speed up), 
- [ ] bullet flashing/muzzle flare effect
- [ ] asteroids flash or change color when hit
- [ ] Power ups randomly appear around screen for several seconds which change projectile type/power/appearance:
  - [ ] Speed up (or slow down)
  - [ ] Boost (or add boost ability in general)
  - [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] Level progression:
  - [ ] Higher level (i.e. more time) asteroids take longer to break up, or break up into smaller divisions
- [ ] 
- [ ] Dividing play session into levels. After a certain time, 'level 2' flashes on screen and difficulty ramps each level increase. Also next to timer, put level.
- [ ]
- [ ] Points every asteroid hit
- [ ] Timer (counts from 0)
- [ ] Time is added to final score or possibly multipled up (every second = 10 or 100 points)
- [ ] 
- [ ]
- [ ]
- [ ]
- [ ] 
- [ ] 



Borrow from minesweeper:

- [ ] Game Start screen
- [ ] Game win/loss screen
  - [ ] Timer
  - [ ] Score
  - [ ] Total level
  - [ ] 
- [ ] Exit game through main game
- [ ] Highscores (from start screen)
- [ ] Submit highscores
- [ ] Profile scores and logging in





 

## (9) To do for all games
- [x] create start game landing screen: + start game btn; + high scores btn
- [x] end game/win game screen, + view score, + submit score, + see high scores, + restart game
- [x] if user logged in, can save high score (post to user array)
- [x] profile page where scores can be displayed
- [ ] have 8-bit chiptune stylized music play during game (with button that starts and stops music, maybe a speaker pic that gets struck through)
- [ ] volume increase/decrease for music
- [ ] play through albums as 8-bit, and can play next song in list

## (14) Project status

This project is completed. 

Otherwise it has a couple of minor, non-game-breaking bug issues:
- Cards can be inserted into tableau piles behind other cards. You have to make sure you drop the card onto the correct (topmost) card.
- Sometimes cards dropped onto tableau piles turn facedown. You have to click them to turn them back faceup.
- Further development to fix these issues needed.
